# 🎓 Anna University Grade Automation to Google Sheets

This project automates the process of logging into the [Anna University SEMS student portal](https://acoe.annauniv.edu/sems/student/mark), scraping your semester grades, and uploading them into a **Google Sheet**, with each session saved in a separate tab (`session1`, `session2`, etc.).

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔒 Manual login (CAPTCHA-friendly)
- 🔍 Automatically fetches grades and GPA from all sessions
- 🗂️ Creates individual tabs for each session (`session1`, `session2`, ...)
- ☁️ Uploads all data to **Google Sheets**
- ✅ Minimal setup and fast execution

---

## 📁 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Google Chrome (latest)
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) (must match your Chrome version)
- A Google account and a Google Sheet

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository (Optional)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/annauniv-grade-sheet.git
cd annauniv-grade-sheet
```

Or just create a folder and save your script there.

---

### 2. Install Required Python Packages
```bash
pip install selenium gspread oauth2client
```

---

### 3. Setup Google Sheets API

#### 🔧 A. Enable APIs
1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable these APIs:
   - **Google Sheets API**
   - **Google Drive API**

#### 🔐 B. Create Service Account
1. In **"APIs & Services > Credentials"**, click **"Create Credentials > Service Account"**
2. Name it anything (e.g. `sheet-uploader`)
3. Once created, go to the **Keys tab**
4. Click **“Add Key > Create new key > JSON”**
5. This downloads a file — rename it to:
   ```
   credentials.json
   ```

#### 📤 C. Share Google Sheet with Service Account
1. Create a new Google Sheet (e.g. `Anna University Grades`)
2. Open the `credentials.json` and copy the `"client_email"` (e.g. `my-bot@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
3. Share the Google Sheet with this email (Editor access)

---

## ✏️ How to Use

### 1. Run the Script
```bash
python grade_uploader.py
```

### 2. Log In Manually
- A browser window will open
- Log into the student portal yourself (solve the CAPTCHA)
- After logging in, press `Enter` in the terminal

### 3. Automation Begins
- The script will scrape your grades for all sessions
- Each session is saved in a separate tab (`session1`, `session2`, ...) inside your Google Sheet
